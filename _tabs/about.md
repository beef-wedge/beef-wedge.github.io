  - The FINALS
  - ULTRAKILL
  - ROUNDS
  - PolyTrack
  - Red Dead Redemption 2 (and 1)
  - Titanfall 2
  - Counter Strike 2
  - And many more

I have a handful of projects that I am working on. I tend to move from one project to the next as motivation shifts. Some current projects of mine:
  - Multiple games made with Godot
  - Setting up a personal homelab
  - Learning 3D modeling with Blender
