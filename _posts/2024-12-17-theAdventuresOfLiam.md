## The Adventures of Liam (2024)

**The Adventures of Liam** is my first Godot project. It is a basic platformer with just about the simplest graphics possible. It's about the main character (Liam) needing to clear an only-up like platformer to get his Taco Bell.

This project probably won't be fully completed for a while (but check back for updates!), but I put it here because it was my first game outside of pure python.
