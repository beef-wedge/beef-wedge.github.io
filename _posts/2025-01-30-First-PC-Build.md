## Overview

This is the first PC building experience I've had. I've taken apart older computers with no real value nowadays, but this is my first real start to finish PC build that actually produced a functional computer.

The PC uses a MSI B650-p motherboard, with an AM5 socket. I used a AMD 5 7600x processor with a base clock speed of 4.7 GHz and a maximum boost speed of 5.3 GHz. It can draw a max of around 105 watts of power.

My RAM is 32 GB of DDR5 RAM, clocked at 5600MHZ

The GPU that I chose was the AMD Radeon RX 570 4GB for my GPU, as I happened to have one laying around and I thought that I would try it before blowing $200-300 on a modern GPU. It has exceeded my expectations for such a low end card, although I do think the CPU is carrying this GPU. I'll probably upgrade it in the future, but for now, it's okay.

My PSU is the Thermaltake 700W. It's cheap, and although it doesn't have great quality, it is a good enough solution to get the PC running stably.

The case that I chose was the Corsair 4000D Airflow, which comes with 2 case fans (non-RGB), although I did add 2 extra fans that I had on hand during the build. Together, they have no issues cooling the PC.

Cooling the CPU is the Cooler Master 212 Halo RGB (Black). It is cost effective, high quality, and has RGB (Not necessary for me, but is always nice to have the feature).

I picked up all these parts at my nearest Best Buy, as they had some deals going on that made the price just under what I would have paid on Amazon or other online vendors.

> Note: **After building this and learning some more**: I do NOT recommend picking up all parts induvidually, especially from a vendor like Best Buy. The overall price is much higher and the money could be spend on other upgrades. Sometimes it may be the right call, but most often it will be cheaper to get a motherboard-CPU-RAM bundle at a place like **MicroCenter**.

In terms of performance, this build exceeds my needs, running my main games (mostly Fortnite) at over 70 fps high settings and at around 120 fps on pro settings, which is more than enough for me. It also absolutely demolishes other general use tasks that a standard office PC could do (of course).
